Introduction
============
The package includes the necessary modules to construct a component model according to the fmi, OSP and DNV-RP-0513 standards.
The model shall be used as part of the SEACo project and as a demonstration model for (efficient) usage of the DNV-RP-0513, 
Assurance of Simulation Models. 

Getting Started
---------------
The project is under construction. Please consult the module documentation for more information.
TODO: Guide users through getting the code up and running on their own system 
and provide a step-by-step explanation how to instantiate a component model.
